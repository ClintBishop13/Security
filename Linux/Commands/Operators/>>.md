This operator is also an output redirector like in the previous operator (`>`) we discussed. However, what makes this operator different is that rather than overwriting any contents within a file, for example, it instead just puts the output at the end.

Following on with our previous example where we have the file "welcome" that has the contents of "hey". If were to use echo to add "hello" to the file using the `>` operator, the file will now only have "hello" and not "hey".

The `>>` operator allows to append the output to the bottom of the file â€” rather than replacing the contents like so:

Using the >> Operator

```shell-session
tryhackme@linux1:~$ echo hello >> welcome
```

Using cat to output the "welcome" file

```shell-session
tryhackme@linux1:~$ cat welcome
hey
hello
```
