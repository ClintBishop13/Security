This operator is what's known as an output redirector. What this essentially means is that we take the output from a command we run and send that output to somewhere else.

A great example of this is redirecting the output of the `echo` command that we learned in Task 4. Of course, running something such as `echo howdy` will return "howdy" back to our terminal â€” that isn't super useful. What we can do instead, is redirect "howdy" to something such as a new file!

Let's say we wanted to create a file named "welcome" with the message "hey". We can run `echo hey > welcome` where we want the file created with the contents "hey" like so:


```shell-session
tryhackme@linux1:~$ echo hey > welcome
```

Using cat to output the "welcome" file

```shell-session
tryhackme@linux1:~$ cat welcome
hey
```
